"""Segmentation-quality analysis: spatial neighbour queries.

UI-agnostic, like :mod:`~segfix.operations`.  Point-set distances are
approximated by sampling each tree down to a few thousand points and querying
a KD-tree — exact enough for "does this touch?" questions at forest scale,
and fast enough to run per keypress.
