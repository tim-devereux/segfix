"""Segmentation-fixing operations on a :class:`~segfix.model.PointCloud`.

Each function mutates the cloud's label array through ``set_labels`` (so every
op is undoable) and returns a short human-readable summary for the status bar.
The functions are deliberately UI-agnostic: the GUI passes in point indices
(from the napari selection) or tree IDs, and these decide what the new labels
should be.
