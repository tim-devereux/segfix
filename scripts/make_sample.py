"""Generate a synthetic forest plot with deliberate segmentation errors.

A dozen cone-ish "trees" of clearly different sizes -- from a 5.5 m sapling
to a 14 m giant -- standing alone and in touching groups, with the five
mistakes a segmentation pipeline really makes, one of each to practise on:

* **wrong side of a boundary** -- where trees 1 and 2 touch, the part of
  tree 2's crown facing tree 1 was given tree 1's ID;
* **over-segmented** -- one tree split into two IDs (7 = trunk and lower
  crown, 8 = the top), next to a small neighbour (9);
* **under-segmented** -- two trees sharing one ID (10);
* **leaked into the ground** -- a tree (11) whose ID also swallowed a patch
  of ground beside it, for Unassign (U);
* **false positive** -- a bush detected as a tree (12), for Noise (X);

plus the two non-tree labels real scans always carry: unassigned ground,
and a handful of noise points floating with nothing near them. Trees 1-3
stand close enough that loading any one brings the other two, which is
where lasso and "lasso tree" (current tree only) visibly differ -- and
where the boundary error above gets fixed.

Usage:  python scripts/make_sample.py sample.ply
        python scripts/make_sample.py --format las sample.las
        python scripts/make_sample.py --spacing 0.01 dense.las
        python scripts/make_sample.py --spacing 0.01 --origin 204300 7223250 12 \
            dense_utm.las

The ``.las`` form mimics arbor's output: XYZ plus a ``treeID`` Extra-Bytes
column, so the LAS editing path (:class:`segfix.treecatalog.LasCatalog`) has
something to open without running the arbor pipeline.

``--spacing`` switches to a scan-like cloud: instead of a few thousand points
filling each tree's volume, points are laid on the surfaces a scanner
actually sees (trunk, crown shell, ground) at the requested pitch. That is
what makes a cloud *dense* — a metre of trunk is one ring of points, but at
5mm there are two hundred of them — and it is how to get a file that trips
segfix's "points closer than 2cm" check and its downsample offer (see
:mod:`segfix.density`). The same deliberate segmentation errors are in it,
so the whole fix-and-save round trip can be exercised at full density.

``--origin`` puts the plot somewhere georeferenced (a UTM easting/northing,
say) instead of at the origin, which is what a real survey looks like and
what trips segfix's *other* load-time question, the global shift (see
:mod:`segfix.shift_ui`). Combined with ``--spacing`` it produces a cloud that
asks both questions in one open, which is the only way to exercise them
together.
